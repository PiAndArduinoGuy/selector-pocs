# Using the Application
1. The first selector will be focused, you can navigate it
2. Once enter is pressed the next selector will be focused 
3. If you hit enter on the second one the thrid will be focused
4. Finally, once the third is 'enter'-ed the first one is focused again and the cycle can repeat

# What i am trying to achieve
I am trying to see how I can abstract away common code between different selector types - to try and see if a Selector 'base-class' can be extracted and reused, tweeking only the templates for the different selector types I have defined
